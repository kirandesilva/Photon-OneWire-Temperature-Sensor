OneWireSpark
============

Provides support for the Dallas One Wire protocol on the Spark core.

I have made minor tweeks to the work of many others and collected it
here for use within the web build tool.

Simply click the libs button in the web build tool at spark.io
and add this lib to your project.

Refer to the ReadTemp.ino example code for basic use of the lib.
